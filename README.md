## Judges — 60-second skim

If you only read one section, read this. Five things differentiate Sendero from the typical Frontier submission and from Colosseum history:

1. **Real Solana protocol contribution, not just SDK consumption.** Sendero authored a `@solana/kit`-based Gateway signer that Circle itself doesn't ship. Circle's stock `toSolanaSigner` only signs transactions; Gateway's `signBurnIntents` needs `signMessage`. We wrote the signer wrapper (Phase 4.5, shipped 2026-05-11) — that's the load-bearing primitive making Sol-source crosschain spend work end-to-end. See [`packages/circle/src/gateway-signer.ts::getOrCreateTenantSolanaSigner`](./packages/circle/src/gateway-signer.ts) and the unified deposit core at [`packages/circle/src/gateway-deposit-core.ts`](./packages/circle/src/gateway-deposit-core.ts).

2. **Two Anchor programs deployed on sol-devnet — not just SPL wrappers.** [`sendero_guest_escrow`](https://explorer.solana.com/address/9NHw47GifDKsPDggQeQd53sNrAsBWeSayzvvSr2tjUL8?cluster=devnet) + [`agentic_commerce`](https://explorer.solana.com/address/4dvtCnTgoJpnmjc9zqBTgEdCiGyHkBHFtDquMgXE1PR9?cluster=devnet). Real prefund / reserve / commit / settle / refund flows on Solana, not a Solana-flavored façade over an EVM contract. Plus Metaplex Core for trip-stamp NFTs and Metaplex Agent Registry for on-chain identity.

3. **Vertical AI thesis match — not consumer DeFi or NFT.** YC's RFS pegs each AI-native service vertical at $100-300M+ ARR. Sendero is that bet for travel ops: a regulated B2B2B industry with real supply (Duffel + StableTravel — flights, hotels, activities, transfers, reference data), not toy mocks. Past Colosseum winners shipped single-chain consumer DeFi or NFT — Sendero ships vertical AI infrastructure with a real supplier graph.

4. **B2B2B, not B2C.** Three audiences, three channels, one ledger:
   - **TMC operator** (paying tenant) on the web dashboard
   - **Corporate buyer** with Sendero installed in *their own* Slack workspace (B2B2B install)
   - **Traveler** on WhatsApp
   - All three reconcile on `/dashboard/inbox/[tripId]` via Liveblocks fan-out. `Tenant.primaryChain` cascade refuses silent Arc fallback for Sol tenants — typed `*_SOL_DEFERRED` errors keep parity at the compiler. Most agent projects are B2C; this is the layer Concur/Navan/Spotnana can't ship without rebuilding from scratch.

5. **Agent-to-agent commerce surface.** Sendero is on *both* sides of the agentic economy: MCP server + OpenAPI 3.1 + llms.txt + x402 nanopayments. Other AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, autonomous workflows) can call Sendero's 128-tool catalog directly and pay per-call in stablecoin. That's the Frontier-thesis surface for agent commerce — already live at [`/api/mcp`](./apps/app/app/api/mcp).

**Credibility signal.** Won **Best Google Gemini Implementation** at the Arc Hackathon — same team, same codebase, same week we built the full Solana stack. Bilateral execution across two ecosystems isn't common.

## Hackathon Origin & Momentum

Sendero was **built from scratch during this hackathon period**. We worked on it for two events in parallel — the **Arc hackathon** and the **Solana Frontier Hackathon** — with the same codebase entered to both. We already took home **Best Google Gemini Implementation** at the Arc event; the Solana Frontier submission is the same project, same repo, judged on its Solana-native surface.

To see how far we moved inside the contest window — what shipped between the start of Frontier and now — here is our Arc/Google submission: **[lablab.ai/ai-hackathons/nano-payments-arc](https://lablab.ai/ai-hackathons/nano-payments-arc)**.

**Dual-chain by design, not by port.** `Tenant.primaryChain: 'sol' | 'arc'` is a runtime choice from day one. Both chains share the same agent surface, tool catalog (128 tools), MCP server, OpenAPI spec, and ledger — only the settlement adapter swaps. Solana-side: `sendero_guest_escrow`, `agentic_commerce`, Metaplex Core for trip-stamp NFTs, Metaplex Agent Registry for agent identity. EVM-side (Arc): SenderoGuestEscrow + SenderoStamps + ERC-8004. The system is genuinely multi-chain, not single-chain with a port.

**Why this exists.** We built on Y Combinator's thesis that vertical AI agents will replace SaaS, category by category. The hard part wasn't the agent — it was building a lean, replicable template so the same shell could be reused across verticals (legal, real estate, healthcare). Travel ops is the proving ground; the tool catalog is the only thing that swaps per vertical.

### What we're most proud of

- **WhatsApp-native wallet via Circle Gateway.** Gateway lets us mint a single unified USDC balance across EVM and Solana — chain selection becomes a runtime concern, not a user concern. Travelers manage funds inside WhatsApp with zero blockchain UX. Maggi (Brazil) and Félix Pago pioneered WhatsApp stablecoins for cross-border payments; we're taking the next step — a WhatsApp-native wallet driven by a vertical AI agent that actually does the work (book the flight, pay the supplier, file the expense), not just holds the money.
- **A genuinely good WhatsApp flow.** Voice notes are supported. Every share link sent via WhatsApp or Slack runs through our own Open Graph image generator, so multi-tenant customers get fully branded, share-ready cards out of the box. NFT stamps, invoices, itineraries, and approvals all unfurl natively in chat.
- **Multi-tenant operator dashboard with Liveblocks collaboration.** Web is the third surface: operators take over from the AI when needed (or when the AI asks). Liveblocks gives teams real-time collaboration on tenant workspaces, channel management, and handoffs.

### External validation

Off the back of the Arc win, **Google invited us to San Jose** to compete again at the **TechEx Intelligent Enterprise Solutions Hackathon** — enterprise AI adoption track. Same product, new venue, on the strength of the Gemini implementation we shipped during these few weeks: **[lablab.ai/ai-hackathons/techex-intelligent-enterprise-solutions-hackathon](https://lablab.ai/ai-hackathons/techex-intelligent-enterprise-solutions-hackathon)**.

### What's gated by external systems

The biggest practical blocker was **Meta WhatsApp Business verification**. The integration is complete and fully working — we just can't ship a production WhatsApp number without a verified business profile, and three days through Meta's verification flow did not get us there. For the demo we use the **Kapso sandbox** number. A real customer (e.g. a LATAM travel agency) with an established business identity verifies in a normal-length window, attaches their phone, and the same flow runs on their own number. **Slack has no equivalent friction** — OAuth, slash commands, modals, and approvals all work end-to-end against real workspaces.

### Scope clarity

Everything in the pitch deck (this repo's `/pitch` directory) is built. The four Solana programs are deployed and verified on devnet; the 128-tool catalog is live behind MCP and OpenAPI; the WhatsApp + Slack + web + MCP surfaces are wired and operational. Mainnet promotion is gated on plan-tier finalization, not on tech.

<br />

## Deployed contracts

All Sendero settlement, identity, and stamp surfaces are live on testnets — Solana devnet (the primary surface for this submission) and Arc Testnet (parity leg).

## What Sendero is

Sendero is the AI operating layer for travel agencies, TMCs, concierge teams, and corporate travel desks — and the traveler companion they expose on WhatsApp, Slack, web, and MCP. It turns messy travel requests into quotes, approvals, bookings, service actions, refunds, artifacts, invoices, and settlement trails. **Solana is the trust + money backplane**: every flight, hotel, and ground leg can be booked by an AI workflow and settled in USDC on Solana with sub-second finality.

The same monorepo runs an EVM (Arc) settlement leg behind a `Tenant.primaryChain` switch. **Solana is the leg this submission scores against** — Anchor programs deployed to devnet, Metaplex Core for trip stamps, Metaplex Agent Registry for identity, Squads V4 + DCWs for treasury, Phantom Connect for the wallet UX layer. The core idea of having EVM + Solana is based on using Circle Gateway for a Unified USDC balance. This way — travelers onboarded are never exposed to the complexity of bridging between chains or handling multiple wallets; Sendero abstracts away chain differences so every payment, refund, or booking can be settled with USDC wherever it lives, and users interact with a seamless, unified balance regardless of their chain of origin with chain abstraction, no private keys, and gasless transactions for an asset-first UX.

<br />

## Sponsor integrations — what's wired and where it lives

The five Frontier sponsors below each map to a load-bearing surface in Sendero today. None of these are stub demos: they sit on the same `runAgentTurn` runtime, the same canonical `@sendero/tools` registry, the same `WorkflowRun` checkpointed graphs, and the same multi-channel `share` payload that powers WhatsApp, Slack, web, and email.

### 🛡️ Altitude + Squads — treasury & multisig

**Squads V4 Multisig** secures the tenant treasury. Every `Tenant` whose `primaryChain === 'sol'` gets a Squads-managed multisig provisioned at onboarding via `provisionTenantSolanaTreasury` (sibling to the EVM `provisionTenantWallet`). Squads holds upgrade authority on both Sendero Anchor programs (see addresses below) and on the per-tenant treasury PDA. **Altitude** is the financial OS we point operators to for cards, ACH/SEPA/SWIFT, and APY on idle balances — Sendero's `/dashboard/treasury` deep-links into Altitude when the tenant has connected their account.

- **Why:** Sendero moves real traveler money. Booking commissions, settlement fan-outs, and refund flows must not be one-key-controlled. Squads turns "operator approval threshold" from a feature flag into an on-chain invariant.
- **Where in code:** `Tenant.primaryChain` cascade in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md#tenant-primarychain--cascade-invariant) · settlement adapters in [`packages/guest/src/solana.ts`](./packages/guest/src/solana.ts) · platform Solana hot-wallet runbook in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md#solana-gas-abstraction-platform-hot-wallet).
- **Docs:** [Squads Multisig](https://squads.xyz/multisig) · [Altitude](https://altitude.xyz)

### 👻 Phantom — wallet UX + CASH stablecoin

**Phantom Connect** is the recommended embedded wallet for Frontier. Sendero uses it as the traveler-facing wallet layer: email sign-in for first-time travelers, native Phantom for crypto-native users. The same Phantom session signs Squads multisig proposals on the operator side and traveler-side `claim_trip` calls for guest-pass redemptions on the consumer side. **CASH** is the stablecoin surfaced inside the Phantom wallet for tipping, in-app commerce, and prize-payout flows downstream of Sendero (e.g. operator referral rewards, agent-to-agent payouts).

- **Why:** consumer travel demands an onboarding flow that doesn't ask the traveler to learn what a seed phrase is. Phantom Connect ships email-first wallet provisioning with native escape hatches for the travelers who already have a Phantom mobile app — exactly the bimodal user base every TMC absorbing AI agents has to serve.
- **Where in code:** wallet hydration in [`apps/app/components/`](./apps/app/components) (`ClerkWalletBridge` mounted in `AppChrome`) · share-link claim flow in [`packages/guest`](./packages/guest).
- **Docs:** [Phantom Connect](https://docs.phantom.com/phantom-connect) · [React starter](https://github.com/Th3Ya0vi/phantom-embedded-react-starter) · [CASH](https://docs.phantom.com/cash)

### 🟦 Coinbase CDP — x402, agentic market, onramp/offramp

**x402** is how Sendero monetizes its MCP tools to *other AI agents*. Every priced tool in [`packages/tools`](./packages/tools) carries a `priceFor(toolName)` policy; the edge worker's `requirePayment` middleware speaks x402 directly. Agents calling Sendero's `/api/mcp` or `/tools/:name` endpoints settle in stablecoin per-call, no checkout flow, no retained card. The **CDP facilitator** verifies + settles. Sendero registers itself in **Agentic Market** as discoverable agent infrastructure for travel ops, and points operators to **Coinbase Onramp/Offramp** for fiat ↔ stablecoin funding when MoonPay isn't the preferred rail. The **Agentic Wallet Skills** repo informed the shape of `gateway_balance`, `gateway_transfer`, and `swap_and_bridge` in our tool catalog.

- **Why:** SaaS prices the platform; x402 prices the calls. Sendero's pitch — *"a vertical AI agent that other agents can rent by the action"* — is only credible with a working agent-to-agent settlement rail. x402 + CDP facilitator gives us that on day one.
- **Where in code:** edge x402 middleware in [`apps/edge/src/lib/x402-middleware.ts`](./apps/edge/src/lib/x402-middleware.ts) · pricing policy in [`packages/tools/src/pricing.ts`](./packages/tools/src/pricing.ts) · scoped-key + signing controls in [`packages/auth/src/dispatch-auth.ts`](./packages/auth/src/dispatch-auth.ts).
- **Skill installed:** `npx skills add coinbase/agentic-wallet-skills` (live in `.agents/skills/`)
- **Docs:** [x402](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/welcome) · [x402 MCP](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/mcp-server) · [Agentic Market](https://agentic.market/) · [Onramp / Offramp](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp/introduction/welcome) · [Wallet Product Guide](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/server-wallets/comparing-our-wallets)

### 🪪 Metaplex — agent identity, agent tokens, trip stamps

Sendero's Solana leg uses Metaplex three ways:

1. **Metaplex Agent Registry (014)** — every Sendero tenant + traveler agent gets an on-chain identity NFT with a built-in wallet via `provision_identity` on the Sol leg. This is the Solana-native parity for ERC-8004 IdentityRegistry on the Arc leg. See [`packages/metaplex/src/register-tenant-agent.ts`](./packages/metaplex/src/register-tenant-agent.ts) and [`mint-agent-identity.ts`](./packages/metaplex/src/mint-agent-identity.ts).
2. **Metaplex Core trip stamps** — every meaningful trip beat (boarding pass, settlement receipt, itinerary map, trip passport) mints a Core asset via `mintCoreTripStamp`. Same four kinds, same generative art pipeline, Solana-native instead of an ERC-1155 deploy. See [`packages/metaplex/src/mint-trip-stamp.ts`](./packages/metaplex/src/mint-trip-stamp.ts).
3. **Agent token launchpad (roadmap)** — vertical agent tokens for tenant-side resale economics. Captured in the roadmap; not gating this submission.

- **Why:** the agent economy needs durable agent identity *and* user-owned proof-of-trip. Metaplex gives us both in one stack — the `014` registry as identity, Core as the asset model, both production-grade and audited.
- **Where in code:** [`packages/metaplex/`](./packages/metaplex) — Umi factory, register, stamp, mint helpers · primaryChain cascade in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md#tenant-primarychain--cascade-invariant).
- **Docs:** [Register an Agent](https://developers.metaplex.com/agents/register-agent) · [Run an Agent](https://developers.metaplex.com/agents/run-an-agent) · [Launch a Token](https://www.metaplex.com/docs/agents/create-agent-token) · [Agent Kit Docs](https://metaplex.com/docs/agents)

### 🌙 MoonPay — agent money rails, virtual cards, virtual accounts

**MoonPay Agents** is how Sendero gives agents real-world money muscle: virtual accounts so an agent can receive ACH/SEPA, virtual cards so an agent can pay a hotel that doesn't accept stablecoin, on/off-ramps so traveler funds enter and leave the agentic economy without forcing custody migration. Sendero's `/dashboard/treasury` ties MoonPay's flows in alongside Coinbase Onramp — operators pick the rail that matches their geography. The **30+ MoonPay skills** repo is part of the agent's tool surface for cross-chain swaps, balance checks, and commerce flows.

- **Why:** travel touches fiat boundaries that pure-stablecoin agents cannot cross alone — supplier ACH payouts, virtual cards for hotels, ramps for travelers in countries where stablecoin off-ramps are weak. MoonPay closes that gap without leaving the agent runtime.
- **Where in code:** `quote_fx`, ramp surfaces, and the treasury dashboard. Roadmap: virtual-card issuance for guest passes (the Navan-shaped wedge described below).
- **Skill (CLI):** `npm install -g @moonpay/cli` then `moonpay-mcp` setup. (See `.agents/skills/moonpay-mcp/`).

<br />

## Anchor programs deployed (Solana devnet)

Sendero's Solana leg runs two Anchor programs deployed to **sol-devnet**, plus two external programs (Metaplex Core + Agent Registry) consumed via `@sendero/metaplex`. Authority signs through the `SENDERO_SOLANA_PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY` upgrade authority, which is also held under Squads multisig in production rollout.

| Program | Address | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `sendero_guest_escrow` | `9NHw47GifDKsPDggQeQd53sNrAsBWeSayzvvSr2tjUL8` | Solana port of the EVM guest-escrow contract. Prefund / claim / reserve / commit / settle / refund / sweep parity. Powers the Peanut-style guest-pass flow on Solana. |
| `agentic_commerce` | `4dvtCnTgoJpnmjc9zqBTgEdCiGyHkBHFtDquMgXE1PR9` | AI-agent job lifecycle (create / fund / complete / refund). Solana-native, no EVM twin — for agent-to-agent jobs paid in stablecoin. |
| Metaplex Core | `CoREENxT6tW1HoK8ypY1SxRMZTcVPm7R94rH4PZNhX7d` | Trip-stamp NFT minting (BoardingPass / SettlementReceipt / ItineraryMap / TripPassport). |
| Metaplex Agent Registry | `1DREGFgysWYxLnRnKQnwrxnJQeSMk2HmGaC6whw2B2p` | Agent identity + reputation + validation. Solana parity for ERC-8004 on the EVM leg. |

Re-deploy flow + IDL pinning runbook lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md#solana-anchor-program-runbook-devnet). Authority + program-data audit ships in [`apps/admin/lib/contracts/audit-solana.ts`](./apps/admin/lib/contracts/audit-solana.ts) — refresh from `/dashboard/contracts?chain=sol`.

### Solana gas abstraction — platform hot wallet

Circle Gas Station is EVM-only, so Sendero runs a **platform Solana hot wallet** (`SENDERO_SOLANA_PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY`) that JIT-drips ~0.01 SOL into any DCW about to sign. Auto-wired into `deposit / depositFor / spend / bridge` for `circle-wallets` principals on Sol_Devnet / Sol. Refill cadence + low-balance Slack alerting documented in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md#solana-gas-abstraction-platform-hot-wallet). Squads multisig holds the platform-wallet authority before the mainnet flip.

<br />

## The agent runtime — durable, observable, multi-channel

The Solana sponsors above are integrations *on top of* a runtime that Sendero already ships. Three properties make that runtime work:

**Durable workflows.** Every booking, refund, OCR pipeline, and channel-setup wizard is a Vercel Workflow run with `'use step'` checkpoints. The `sendero.book_flight` workflow can pause for hours awaiting `supplier_order_ticketed`, drift across two deploys, and resume from the exact pending step on the next webhook. Pairs with column-level encryption (`pgcrypto` + per-tenant DEK derived via HKDF from a Vercel-env KEK) so the LLM never sees plaintext PII.

**Multi-channel by construction.** A single `ChannelMessage` discriminated union renders to operator web, Slack block kit, WhatsApp interactive, web traveler card, and Resend email. Same canonical shape, four native outputs. Build one, ship four. See [`apps/app/lib/channel-render/`](./apps/app/lib/channel-render).

**Observability + self-healing.** Langfuse owns prompt management + four-judge LLM-as-Judge evaluators per turn. Phoenix indexes the same OpenTelemetry spans for agent-runtime self-introspection: agents call `recall_similar_turns` and `find_resolved_gap` against their own dataset before escalating to a human. Strict dev-only at the agent layer (`NODE_ENV` + `VERCEL_ENV` + caller-key gate). See [`packages/arize-phoenix/`](./packages/arize-phoenix) and [`packages/langfuse/`](./packages/langfuse).

<br />

## Best Use of Gemini — OCR for receivables

Drag a receipt, invoice, boarding pass, or passport into [`/dashboard/scan`](./apps/app/app/(app)/dashboard/scan/page.tsx) and get sub-second structured extraction — schema-pinned, ready to reconcile against a trip. Four document kinds, four Zod schemas in [`packages/ocr/src/schemas/`](./packages/ocr/src/schemas/). `gemini-2.5-flash` by default with `thinkingBudget: 0` (OCR is not a reasoning task), Pro on demand for genuinely ambiguous docs.

**Production hardening:** SSRF guard on URL-fetch, 20 MB payload cap + MIME allowlist, PII audit signal on boarding-pass scans, compliance gate on government-ID scans (`allowSensitive` admin flag), post-Gemini normalization (ISO-4217, ISO-8601, EU/US/JP date forms, European decimal). Two entry points (UI + agent-callable `scan_document` MCP tool), one engine (`extractDocument()`).

### Private passport vault — encrypted boundary, visa as ancillary revenue

Passports get a dedicated privileged path. Client-side MRZ parsed with `mrz-fast` (offline, ICAO 9303 TD3); image bytes discarded before the network call. `pgcrypto` `pgp_sym_encrypt(..., 'cipher-algo=aes256')` via parameterized `$queryRaw`, per-tenant DEK derived via HKDF-SHA256 from a Vercel-env KEK. Agent surface (`check_travel_eligibility`) returns enum codes only — never names, never DOBs, never passport numbers. Sherpa Requirements API v3 layered on top so `apply-product` actions surface as **"Add visa assistance — $185"** ancillary CTAs on the offer card. See [`packages/vault/`](./packages/vault) and the verdict pipeline in [`packages/vault/src/verify.ts`](./packages/vault/src/verify.ts).

### Living trip stamps — Gemini paints, Metaplex Core mints

Every meaningful trip beat (`book_flight` → BoardingPass · `book_flight` again → ItineraryMap refresh · `settle_booking` → SettlementReceipt · final settle → TripPassport) fires a Vercel Workflow that runs Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and a Gemini caption *in parallel*, pins both to IPFS via Pinata, and mints a Metaplex Core asset to the traveler's wallet. ~6 s wall-clock from supplier confirm to minted NFT. The OG unfurl path uses the Vercel Blob copy for sub-100ms preview rendering; the on-chain `tokenURI` resolves through any IPFS gateway. **Proof-of-trip you can put in your pocket** — and a marketing surface that renders inline in any Slack/WhatsApp/X paste.

```
apps/app/workflows/stamps/
├── generate-boarding-pass.ts       ← BoardingPass     (vintage 1960s jet-age)
├── generate-settlement-receipt.ts  ← SettlementReceipt (railway ticket, USDC stamped)
├── generate-itinerary-map.ts       ← ItineraryMap     (WPA poster, redraws on each leg)
└── generate-trip-passport.ts       ← TripPassport     (two-page passport spread, capstone)
```

Idempotency throughout: Pinata is content-addressed, the `mint_stamp` tool is `UNIQUE(kind, primaryKey)` in Postgres, the Metaplex Core mint is keyed off `(kind, tripId, bookingId)`. WDK retries are surgical — Gemini 5xx? Just that step retries. Mint reverts? Image + manifest already pinned, mint re-attempts without re-spending Gemini tokens.

<br />

## Business model — SaaS + x402 nanopayments, audience-split

Two independent revenue legs. **Leg 1 — Recurring SaaS** (Clerk Billing on organizations): four tiers, monthly or annual, zero-card 14-day Pro trial. Plans gate workspaces, production API keys, MCP-server exposure, SSO, white-label, SLA via `has({ feature })`. **Leg 2 — Per-call nanopayments** (x402 via Coinbase CDP, settled in USDC): every priced tool — flight search, policy check, booking hold, confirmation, MCP tool call — is metered and settled.

**Audience split is load-bearing.** TMCs / corporate travel buyers see *only* "monthly platform + included usage + transparent overages". x402 nanopayments are the agent-to-agent settlement rail surfaced to **other AI agents calling Sendero via MCP**, not to humans on `/app/billing/plans`. Source of truth: [`packages/billing/src/plans.ts`](./packages/billing/src/plans.ts). Resolver: [`apps/app/lib/billing-plan.ts`](./apps/app/lib/billing-plan.ts).

| | **Free** | **Basic** | **Pro** | **Enterprise** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Monthly** | $0 | $19/mo | $60/mo | Custom *(list $1,500/mo)* |
| **Workspaces** | 1 | 5 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Production API keys** | 0 *(sandbox only)* | 3 | 25 | Unlimited |
| **Monthly spend cap** | $100 | $2,000 | $20,000 | Unlimited |
| **Nanopayment discount** | — | 15% off | 30% off | 50% off |
| **Booking take-rate discount** | — | 5% off | 10% off | 15% off |
| **WhatsApp + Slack channels** | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Public MCP server** | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |

Trials monetize leg 2 even when leg 1 is $0. Pro+ customers monetize both. Enterprise commits both at negotiated discounts. Clerk subscription keeps the customer; Solana settlement keeps the network.

<br />

## Hardening the x402 edge — scoped keys, signed requests, signed envelopes

x402 monetizes every leaked key adversarially. A stolen bearer that fires 10,000 cheap searches before we revoke is still real money; one that moves USDC is catastrophic. Sendero's three controls — none of which add cost on the hot path:

1. **Scoped API keys** ([`packages/auth/src/dispatch-auth.ts`](./packages/auth/src/dispatch-auth.ts)). Every key carries a scope set: `search`, `bookings`, `settlement`, `treasury`, `documents`, `compliance`, `trip_assistance`, `utilities`, or `*`. Production keys mint with a read-mostly default — **no settlement, no treasury**. The dispatch route filters the tool registry *before the LLM sees it*, so prompt injection cannot sneak the model into calling out-of-scope tools.

2. **HMAC-signed requests for privileged tools.** Keys with `settlement`, `treasury`, or `*` must sign with `x-sendero-ts` + `x-sendero-nonce` + `x-sendero-sig = HMAC-SHA256(sha256(bearer), canonical-string)`. Read-mostly scopes stay bearer-only. Nonce dedup via Upstash `SET NX EX 120s`.

3. **Signed response envelopes — every reply.** Every response carries `x-sendero-trace-id`, `x-sendero-meter-id`, `x-sendero-ts`, `x-sendero-sig`. MITM replays of cached responses are exposed as unpaid.

Public recipe: [`/docs/security`](./apps/docs/content/docs/security.mdx).

<br />

## Developer experience — built so other agents can call us

Sherpa's docs set the B2B API bar; we matched it and closed two gaps. Self-service key issuance (Clerk-native, no form), and per-page markdown exports for every docs page (append `.md` to any `/docs/*` URL). All tooling discovered through one fetch:

- **Canonical OpenAPI 3.1** at `/api/openapi.json`, generated from the [`packages/tools`](./packages/tools) registry. Scalar, Redoc, Postman, Insomnia consume it as-is.
- **Interactive Scalar viewer** at `/api-viewer`. Try any tool, copy the `curl`, deep-link to Clerk's API-key UI.
- **MCP server** at `/api/mcp` (app) and `/mcp` (edge). Same canonical `@sendero/tools` registry over MCP JSON-RPC.
- **x402-gated direct HTTP** at `/tools/:name` on the edge worker.
- **`llms.txt`** at every origin (product app, marketing, docs, help, edge) — see the [surface table](#llms-txt-surfaces) below.

**Time-to-first-success:** sign up → mint key → first nanopayment-billed tool call in under 5 minutes, no sales call, no email thread.

<a id="llms-txt-surfaces"></a>

### llms.txt surfaces

| Surface | Role | `llms.txt` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Product app** | Authenticated console, MCP, webhooks, billing, trips | [www.sendero.travel/llms.txt](https://www.sendero.travel/llms.txt) |
| **Marketing** | Public positioning, pricing, audiences | [sendero.travel/llms.txt](https://sendero.travel/llms.txt) |
| **Help** | Support articles and troubleshooting | [help.sendero.travel/llms.txt](https://help.sendero.travel/llms.txt) |
| **Docs** | MCP integration, tool catalog, x402, API shapes | [docs.sendero.travel/llms.txt](https://docs.sendero.travel/llms.txt) |
| **Edge** | Direct worker discovery for MCP and `/tools` | [edge.sendero.travel/llms.txt](https://edge.sendero.travel/llms.txt) |

Implementation lives in [`packages/llms`](./packages/llms). Each Next app wires `app/llms.txt/route.ts` to that package.

## How Sendero designs the travel experience

Sendero is not a chat on top of a booking tool — it is a **workflow engine with channels on top** for multi-tenant agencies and corporate travel desks. The design principles below are codified as a skill (`.agents/skills/design-travel-experience-ai`).

**One share, many channels.** A traveler-facing step produces a single `share` payload (title, body, bullets, CTAs, optional image URL). The same shape renders as a WhatsApp interactive message, a Slack block kit card (for operators), an email via [`@sendero/notifications`](./packages/notifications), and a web card in [`apps/app/components/ai-elements/`](./apps/app/components/ai-elements). If a field matters to UX, it lives in `share` — never hard-coded in one adapter. A flow can start on WhatsApp, resume on the web, and mail a receipt — one durable run.

**Roles drive surfaces.** `Role` enum in [`packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`](./packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma):

| Role | Primary channel | What they see | Key affordances |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **agency_admin** | Web console + Slack | All tenant trips, policy editor, approval inbox, commission reports, guest-pass issuance. | Prefund trips, issue guest passes, override policy with memo, approve exceptions, bulk prefund via `agencyCohortWorkflow`. |
| **finance** | Web console + email | Invoices, settlement tx list, refund ledger, commission splits. | Export CSV, open artifact pack (`opsArtifactPackWorkflow`), drill from invoice → settle tx → per-leg split. |
| **traveler** | WhatsApp / web / email | Their own trips, policy summary, offer cards, check-in nudges, receipts. | Book within policy, pick ancillaries, approve rebooks on disruption. |
| **guest** | WhatsApp (entry) + web (claim) + email | One trip — the one they were invited to — and only after claim. | Claim via Phantom passkey, pick offer within prefunded budget, confirm booking, receive receipt. No long-lived account. |

**Guest passes — the Navan-shaped wedge.** A guest pass is a WhatsApp/Slack-shareable link that lets someone without a Sendero account spend a prefunded USDC budget on one trip, then walk away. `prefund_trip` escrows USDC on-chain via `sendero_guest_escrow`; [`@sendero/guest`](./packages/guest) emits a Peanut-style share link (private key in URL fragment, never server-side); the guest enrolls a Phantom passkey and signs `claim_trip`; the agent books inside the budget. Unspent budget auto-refunds at expiry. Canonical workflows: `guestPrefundWorkflow` (single seat) and `agencyCohortWorkflow` (bulk).

**Workflows are durable objects.** [`packages/workflows`](./packages/workflows) persists every `WorkflowRun`. `pause` steps suspend and resume from the exact pending step when a webhook / traveler reply / approval lands — days later, different channel, different device. Travelers never have to "stay on this page." Every pending state is reachable from their inbox with a live link.

**Confirmations persist via email.** Chat is ephemeral. Legal and airline receipts are not. Every terminal success/failure mails via [`@sendero/notifications`](./packages/notifications) (Resend) — `sendInvoice` with the PDF, `publicUrl` to `/invoice/<token>`, on-chain settle tx hash. Sent from the workflow's terminal step, not the channel adapter.

**Blockchain × AI — the chain is the trust root.** Escrow before tool call (`prefund_trip` + `reserve_booking` lock funds before the LLM is allowed to book). Policy as on-chain check, not a prompt instruction. Settle only on confirmed state (`settle_booking` fires on the supplier ticketed webhook, not on the LLM saying "I booked it"). Every terminal surface includes the tx hash + explorer URL.

<br />

## What this submission demonstrates against the Frontier rubric

| Frontier criterion | What Sendero ships |
|---|---|
| **Solana-native settlement** | `sendero_guest_escrow` Anchor program on devnet; USDC settle on every `confirm_booking`; tenant `primaryChain: 'sol'` cascade. |
| **Agent identity + reputation** | Metaplex Agent Registry mints per-tenant + per-traveler agent NFTs at onboarding via `provision_identity`. |
| **Asset model** | Metaplex Core trip stamps for four trip beats, generative art via Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, IPFS-pinned manifests. |
| **Treasury controls** | Squads V4 multisig as program-upgrade authority + tenant-treasury authority. Altitude as the operator-side financial OS deep-link. |
| **Wallet UX** | Phantom Connect for traveler-facing email-first onboarding + native crypto-user fast-path. |
| **Agentic commerce rail** | x402 via Coinbase CDP facilitator on every priced MCP tool. Sendero registers in Agentic Market as travel-ops infra. |
| **Real-world money** | MoonPay virtual cards + virtual accounts + ramps for the supplier-side flows where stablecoin doesn't reach. |
| **AI quality discipline** | Arize Phoenix as the one-place AI & agent engineering platform — development, observability, and evaluation. Langfuse complements with 4-judge LLM-as-Judge per turn + prompt management. Both gated by the Responsible-AI ship guard. |
| **Production hardening** | Scoped API keys, HMAC-signed privileged calls, signed response envelopes, encrypted-by-default workflow runtime. |

<br />

## One-liner setup (mise)

All tool versions (bun 1.3.10, node 22.18, prisma 5.22) are pinned in [`.mise.toml`](./.mise.toml) and auto-activate on `cd`.

```bash
curl https://mise.run | sh                                   # install mise
eval "$(mise activate zsh)"                                  # or bash
mise install && mise run bootstrap                           # tools + deps + prisma client
lefthook install --force                                     # enable git hooks
```

Then:

```bash
mise run dev              # full stack (apps + edge + Ponder indexer)
mise run dev:web          # web only → http://localhost:3010
mise run typecheck        # turbo run typecheck
```

### Run it locally with `bun dev:complete`

If you'd rather skip `mise` and drive everything from bun, this is the path. `bun dev:complete` boots seven workspaces in parallel through turbo with streaming UI: the main app, marketing site, help center, docs, edge worker, Ponder indexer, and Storybook.

#### 1. Prerequisites

- **bun 1.3.10+** — `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
- **Node 22.18+** — for `prisma` codegen and Anchor scripts
- **Postgres** — Neon project (free tier works) or a local Postgres reachable on a `postgresql://…` URL
- **(optional) Anchor 0.30+** — only if you plan to redeploy the Solana programs; the deployed devnet program IDs in the README work out of the box

#### 2. Install and seed env

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/sendero && cd sendero
bun install                                  # workspaces + prisma postinstall
cp .env.example .env.local                   # copy the env scaffold
```

Open `.env.local` and fill **at minimum** the keys below. Every other key in `.env.example` is documented inline; most are optional for a first boot.

| Variable | Purpose | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` / `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` | Postgres for app + prisma + LISTEN/NOTIFY | [Neon](https://console.neon.tech) (pooled + direct + unpooled URLs) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Auth, orgs, billing tier | [Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` *or* `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Agent LLM. Gateway is preferred; Gemini-direct is the fallback | [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) / [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/dashboard/ai) |
| `DUFFEL_API_TOKEN` (`duffel_test_…`) | Flights + hotels (sandbox is free) | [Duffel](https://duffel.com/docs/guides/quick-start) |
| `PASSPORT_VAULT_KEK` | 32-byte base64; encrypts the passport vault | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `SENDERO_SOLANA_PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY` | Base58 keypair; pays SOL gas for Gateway-mint drips | `solana-keygen new` + `cat` the JSON, or Phantom export |
| `SENDERO_SOLANA_RPC_URL` | Solana RPC | Defaults to `https://api.devnet.solana.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Same origin you open in the browser | Keep `http://localhost:3010` for dev |

Channel/sponsor surfaces (`KAPSO_*`, `SLACK_*`, `COINBASE_CDP_*`, `MOONPAY_*`, `LIVEBLOCKS_*`) degrade gracefully when missing — the app boots and the affected surface logs a warn. Add them only when you want to exercise that channel.

Validate your env wiring at any point:

```bash
bun env:validate                              # checks process.env vs zod schemas in @sendero/env
bun run scripts/config-doctor.ts              # diffs .env.example vs what TS actually reads
```

#### 3. Database bootstrap

```bash
bun db:generate                               # prisma client
bun db:migrate                                # apply migrations to your DATABASE_URL
bun db:seed                                   # optional — seeds plan tiers + demo tenant
```

#### 4. Run the full stack

```bash
bun dev:complete
```

Streaming UI prints each workspace separately. Once stabilized, the following ports are live:

| Port | Workspace | URL |
|---|---|---|
| `3010` | `@sendero/app` — main app, agent runtime, MCP, dashboards | http://localhost:3010 |
| `3011` | `@sendero/marketing` — sendero.travel landing | http://localhost:3011 |
| `3012` | `@sendero/help` — help center | http://localhost:3012 |
| `3020` | `@sendero/docs` — docs site + API viewer | http://localhost:3020 |
| `3021` | `@sendero/edge` — Hono edge worker (x402 paywall, Routing Middleware) | http://localhost:3021 |
| `3030` | `@sendero/storybook` — component sandbox | http://localhost:3030 |
| — | `@sendero/indexer` — Ponder indexer (no HTTP port; logs to stream) | — |

Want a leaner boot? Three smaller scripts cover the common subsets:

```bash
bun dev                                       # @sendero/app only — fastest cold start
bun dev:edge                                  # edge worker only
bun dev:all                                   # every workspace including any new ones
```

#### 5. (Optional) Solana platform wallet bootstrap

The platform hot wallet pays SOL gas for Gateway mint operations and is required if you want to exercise the full Solana settlement path. One-shot bootstrap:

```bash
bun apps/app/scripts/_local/provision-solana-platform.ts
```

This generates a base58 keypair, attempts a devnet airdrop (~1 SOL), and prints the value to paste into `SENDERO_SOLANA_PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY`. Top up via [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com) if the airdrop fails — 1 SOL covers ~100 transfers.

#### 6. Troubleshooting

- **Prisma client out of date** → re-run `bun db:generate` after any schema change.
- **`PASSPORT_VAULT_KEK` unset** errors in agent runtime → generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32` and restart. Most agent tools tolerate it missing; `scan_passport_inline` does not.
- **Wallet balance SSE silent** → set `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` (Neon's direct URL). Without it the stream falls back to a 10s slow-poll and logs a warn.
- **Port already in use** → run `mise run ports` (kills Sendero dev processes) or override with `APP_PORT=4010 bun dev:complete`.
- **AI tools refuse to start** → confirm one of `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set. The cascade is Gateway → Gemini → OpenAI → Anthropic.

### Anchor (Solana programs)

```bash
cd contracts/programs-solana
anchor build
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
anchor idl init --provider.cluster devnet \
  --filepath target/idl/sendero_guest_escrow.json \
  9NHw47GifDKsPDggQeQd53sNrAsBWeSayzvvSr2tjUL8
```

Authority + IDL audit refresh from `/dashboard/contracts?chain=sol`. Re-deploy runbook in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md#solana-anchor-program-runbook-devnet).

### Required env (excerpt — full list in `.env.example`)

- `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` — Vercel AI Gateway (Gemini-first; preferred)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Gemini direct fallback
- `DUFFEL_API_TOKEN` — flights + hotels
- `SENDERO_SOLANA_PLATFORM_PRIVATE_KEY` — base58, signs JIT-gas drips + program upgrades (Squads multisig in prod)
- `SENDERO_SOLANA_RPC_URL` — defaults to `https://api.devnet.solana.com`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PHANTOM_*` — Phantom Connect embedded wallet keys
- `COINBASE_CDP_*` — CDP facilitator + x402 settlement
- `MOONPAY_API_KEY` — agent rails (virtual cards, accounts, ramps)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` — auth
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` — same origin you open in the browser

<br />

## Stack

- **Solana devnet** — `sendero_guest_escrow` + `agentic_commerce` Anchor programs; Metaplex Core for stamps; Metaplex Agent Registry for identity.
- **Squads V4 Multisig** — program-upgrade authority + tenant-treasury authority.

### Hackathon resource advisor

The Colosseum sponsor + RPC + build-path index is mounted as a skill so future iterations can re-query the live corpus when adding sponsors:

```bash
npx skills add ColosseumOrg/colosseum-resources
```

(Already installed at `.agents/skills/colosseum-resources/`.)

<br />

## Agent-to-agent integration

Sendero can be called by another AI agent as a travel sub-agent:

- **`llms.txt` manifests** — see the [surface table](#llms-txt-surfaces) above; each app links to the others for cross-discovery.
- **MCP** — `/mcp` on the edge worker and `/api/mcp` on the app expose the shared `@sendero/tools` registry over MCP JSON-RPC.
- **x402 direct HTTP** — `/tools/:name` exposes the same tools as x402-gated endpoints (Coinbase CDP facilitator).
- **Workflows** — `/api/workflows/run` and `/api/workflows/resume` run named plans such as `sendero.book_flight`, which handles search, policy, escrow reservation, ticketing pauses, settlement, and invoice generation.

Start with [`apps/docs/content/docs/agent-to-agent-booking.mdx`](./apps/docs/content/docs/agent-to-agent-booking.mdx) for the complete delegated booking flow.

<br />

## Why we built this

Inspired by Y Combinator's thesis that **vertical AI agents may become larger businesses than SaaS** ([Lightcone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASABxNenD_U), [YC Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lvmmk85ArWg)). The deeper idea is **replicability**: a template for vertical AI agents on Solana, paid for with nanopayments and usage-based billing instead of flat SaaS seats. Price tracks **work actually completed** in fully automated flows, which weakens the assumption that every workflow must live behind a traditional product UI.

Travel is the first vertical. Legal, real-estate, and healthcare are next — same template app shell, same channel adapters, same settlement rail, same billing plumbing. **The only thing that changes per vertical is the tool catalog.** See [`apps/admin/`](./apps/admin) for the meta-control plane.

### Enterprise travel — Navan-shaped, but agent-native

Corporate travel is a Navan-shaped market. Ramp's March 2026 acquisition of Juno (the non-employee guest-travel platform) is a public bet that **guest travel** is a first-class enterprise problem, not a sidecar to employee booking. Sendero's `sendero_guest_escrow` program + Metaplex agent identity + Phantom-Connect onboarding + Squads-secured treasury is aimed at that same wedge: **agent-native, on-chain settlement and policy** for the trips enterprises already pay for, without assuming everyone lives inside one vendor's UI. Native WhatsApp and Slack support means we meet travelers where they already are.
